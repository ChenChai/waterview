# waterlook

University of Waterloo's public-facing course information is fairly complete on a term-to-term basis. However, tools are lacking to view information over the course of several terms, and Waterlook aims to display insights across the span of multiple years.

Waterlook is written with Django back-end and with the built-in HTML templating engine for front-end.
